This project started while I was perusing other Github repositories. I was blown away by <a href="https://github.com/ggeop">Georgios Papachristou's</a> <a href="https://github.com/ggeop/Python-ai-assistant">git repo on an AI assistant</a>. However it was a huge struggle to figure where to start reading the code in the repo (Ironically, it was the Jarvis library). But that's where I decided to make this tool

## Functionality:
Analysis the folder structure of the git repo, identifies all .py files and builds a graph that shows which files call which other files.

## To-do:
Only parent folders are mapped right now. Need to add sub-folders to the mix.
